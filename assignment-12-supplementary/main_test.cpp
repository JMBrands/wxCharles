/*
    Write your own unit tests for this assignment.
    Take a look at the documentation on Brightspace to help you out.
    Essentially you want test cases that:
    1. load the bounded gift store
    2. load the respective wish list
    3. compute the optimal gifts
    4. check that the remaining budget has the correct value
    5. repeat steps 3 and 4 several times to see if items actually go out of stock (giving potentially different solutions)
